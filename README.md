# Machine Learning Lab 1 (22012)

This repository contains solutions for the first lab session of Machine Learning Lab 22012. The assignments focus on basic programming tasks involving string manipulation, matrix operations, and list handling.

## Assignment Notes

1. **Read Instructions Carefully**: Please ensure that you read and understand the assignment notes before starting. Adherence to guidelines is crucial for successful completion.
2. **Code Submission**: The code should be checked into GitHub. Details for submission will be provided during the lab session.
3. **Prerequisite Assignments**: Ensure that all prerequisite assignments are completed before attending the next lab session.

## Coding Instructions

1. **Modularization**:
   - The code should be modularized, with each functionality encapsulated in a function.
   - Create multiple functions as needed, ensuring all functions are present within a single code block if using Jupyter or Colab notebooks.

2. **Print Statements**:
   - No print statements should be included within the functions.
   - All outputs should be handled in the main program or execution block.

3. **Variable Naming**:
   - Use proper and descriptive names for variables to enhance code readability and maintainability.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - For lists, strings, and matrices, you may use appropriate input values.

5. **Inline Documentation**:
   - Include inline comments within the code blocks to explain the logic and steps being taken.

## Solutions Overview

### 1. Counting Vowels and Consonants
A function that takes a string as input and returns the count of vowels and consonants.

### 2. Matrix Multiplication
A function that accepts two matrices and returns their product, checking if they are multipliable. If not, an error message is returned.

### 3. Common Elements in Lists
A function that finds the number of common elements between two lists containing integers.

### 4. Transpose of a Matrix
A function that takes a matrix as input and returns its transpose.
